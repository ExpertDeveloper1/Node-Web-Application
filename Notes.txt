Basic File structure for every node project

--ApplicationFolder
	--package.json	-->required		package.json is pretty much a list of names in json format containing all the libraries
						(we call them modules) we depend on. The application depends on them.
	
	--node_modules	-->required		node_modules correspond to what is listed on package.json. It has all the source files
						of every module declared in package.json
	
	--(All otherfiles)			your html, javascript, css, and other files go here. They can be in any directory structure
						as long as the references in your code are done correctly.
